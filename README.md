## 🚀 Featured Projects

### [MLOps Pipeline — Diabetes Prediction](https://github.com/velosoberti/MLOps)

**End-to-end machine learning infrastructure** demonstrating production-grade MLOps practices.

```
Data Versioning → Feature Store → Model Training → API Serving → Monitoring
      DVC            Feast          MLflow           Flask        Dashboard
```

| Component | Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| Data Versioning | DVC | Track and version datasets |
| Feature Store | Feast | Centralized feature management (online + offline) |
| Orchestration | Airflow | Automated pipeline scheduling |
| Experiment Tracking | MLflow | Model registry and metrics |
| Serving | Flask API | Real-time predictions |
| Visualization | Streamlit | Interactive EDA |

**Key Highlights:**
- Complete pipeline from raw data to production API
- Hybrid serving architecture (batch + real-time)
- Containerized infrastructure with Docker
- Interactive dashboard for monitoring and predictions

### [AI Audit Pipeline — Document Compliance](https://github.com/velosoberti/ai_audit_project)

**Hybrid RAG system** for automated document auditing using vector search and LLM evaluation.

```
PDF Ingestion → Hybrid Embeddings → Vector Search → LLM Evaluation → Audit Report
  pdfplumber       BGE-M3            Milvus         Gemini           JSON/TXT
```

| Component | Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| Vector Database | Milvus | Hybrid search (sparse + dense) |
| Embeddings | BGE-M3 | Multi-modal retrieval |
| LLM | Gemini 2.5 Flash | Criterion evaluation |
| Search Strategy | Deep Agent | Iterative query refinement |

**Key Highlights:**
- Hybrid search combining lexical and semantic matching
- Deep Research Agent with automatic query reformulation
- Optional "Possible Answers" pre-analysis for enhanced retrieval
- Confidence-based evaluation with evidence tracking
